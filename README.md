### Greedy Merchants (ECS Edition)

Greedy merchants is a game we developed for the Ludum Dare 40 with a couple of friends. This repository holds a reimplementation using Svelto-ECS. My intention is to keep this updated to the latest changes in Svelto-ECS as much as possible, so that this stands as a valid example of how gameplay is implemented using it.
