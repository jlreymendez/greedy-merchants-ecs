# Greedy Merchants (ECS Edition)

This is a reimplementation of a game called Greedy Merchants using the Svelto.ECS framework. My intention is to keep this updated to the latest changes in the framework so that it stands as a valid example of how gameplay is implemented using it.

## Getting Started

Since this project is using Svelto.ECS 3.0 which is not yet available through openupm I decided to use git submodules to handle Svelto dependencies. In order for this dependencies to be loaded into the project you need to run the following command `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
